        The ngRoute module helps your application to become a Single Page Application.
        If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application), with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.
        The ngRoute module routes your application to different pages without reloading the entire application.
    -->
    <!--Navigate to "red.html", "green.html", and "blue.html"-->
    <p><a href="#/!">Main</a></p>

    <a href="#!red">Red</a>
    <a href="#!green">Green</a>
    <a href="#!blue">Blue</a>

    <!--our application needs a container to put the content provided by the routing.
    This container is the ng-view directive.
    Applications can only have one ng-view directive, and this will be the placeholder for all views provided by the route.
    There are three different ways to include the ng-view directive in your application-->
    <!-- First way: -->
    <div ng-view></div>
    <!-- Second way:
    <ng-view></ng-view> -->
    <!-- Third way:
    <div class="ng-view"></div> -->

    <p>Click on the links to navigate to "red.html", "green.html", "blue.html", or back to "main.html"</p>
