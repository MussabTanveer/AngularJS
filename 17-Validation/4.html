    AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states.
    The following classes are added to, or removed from, input fields:
        ng-untouched The field has not been touched yet
        ng-touched The field has been touched
        ng-pristine The field has not been  modified yet
        ng-dirty The field has been modified
        ng-valid The field content is valid
        ng-invalid The field content is not valid
        ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
        ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required
    The following classes are added to, or removed from, forms:
        ng-pristine No fields has not been modified yet
        ng-dirty One or more fields has been modified
        ng-valid The form content is valid
        ng-invalid The form content is not valid
        ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
        ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required
    The classes are removed if the value they represent is false.
    Add styles for these classes to give your application a better and more intuitive user interface.

    <div ng-app="">
        <form name="myForm">
            <p>Try writing in the input field:</p>
            <input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
        </form>
        <p>The input field requires content, and will therefore become green when you write in it.</p>
        <p>The form gets a "ng-dirty" class when the form has been modified, and will therefore turn pink.</p>
