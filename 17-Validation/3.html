    <!--
        AngularJS is constantly updating the state of both the form and the input fields.
        Input fields have the following states:
            $untouched The field has not been touched yet
            $touched The field has been touched
            $pristine The field has not been modified yet
            $dirty The field has been modified
            $invalid The field content is not valid
            $valid The field content is valid
        They are all properties of the input field, and are either true or false.
        Forms have the following states:
            $pristine No fields have been modified yet
            $dirty One or more have been modified
            $invalid The form content is not valid
            $valid The form content is valid
            $submitted The form is submitted
        They are all properties of the form, and are either true or false.
        You can use these states to show meaningful messages to the user. Example, if a field is required, and the user leaves it blank, you should give the user a warning
    -->
    <div ng-app="">
        <!--Show an error message if the field has been touched AND is empty-->
        <p>Try leaving the first input field blank:</p>
        <form name="myForm">
            <p>Name:
                <input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
                <span ng-show="myForm.myName.$touched && myForm.myName.$invalid">The name is required</span>
            </p>
            <p>Address:
                <input name="myAddress" ng-model="myAddress" required>
                <span ng-show="myForm.myAddress.$invalid">The address is required</span>
            </p>
        </form>

        <p>We use the ng-show directive to only show the error message if the field has been touched AND is empty.</p>
    </div>
